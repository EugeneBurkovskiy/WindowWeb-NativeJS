## Task
I did this project after the [FoodWeb-NativeJS](https://github.com/EugeneBurkovskiy/FoodWeb-NativeJS) and the main goal was to consolidate all the stages of the previous work. All the same tricks are used here, but a little more complicated. Interaction with DOM elements on the page , "POST" requests to the server. The project is built on a modular structure using webpack which is assembled using the assembler Gulp. The project was received with a ready-made layout made with Bootstrap.
